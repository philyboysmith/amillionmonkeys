$content = "<p>amillionmonkeys worked with local charity Sussex Wildlife Trust to redesign and develop their website from scratch.</p>
<p>While <a href=\"http://www.pureedesign.com\">Puree Design</a> created a look and feel for the site, we carried out an exhaustive audit of existing assets, ran a series of stakeholder interviews, agreed some KPIs and began to wireframe the site. Using the new design guidelines we produced a couple of static comps before starting work in the browser.</p>
<p>The old site was actually six sites (one ancient proprietary CMS and the rest Wordpress self-hosted micro-sites). The new site is powered by <a href=\"http://grabaperch.com\">Perch Runway</a>, it's much faster and has led to a clear and measurable increase in both donations and membership.</p>";
